We learned about relational operators and how they can classify the relationship between two values. Your job is to write the function getRelationship(x,y) function, which should return a string representing whether x is >, < or = y. For example:

var rel = getRelationship(2, 3);
console.log(rel); // <
If one or both of the values aren't numbers, your function should output:

"Can't compare relationships because [this value] and [that value] [is]/[are] not [a] number[s]."
where [this value] and [that value] are replaced with the non-numerical values. The sentence should be grammatically correct by outputting either is or are and pluralizing number if necessary.

For example:

var rel1 = getRelationship("this", 2);
console.log(rel1); // "Can't compare relationships because this is not a number"

var rel2 = getRelationship("that");
console.log(rel2) // "Can't compare relationships because that and undefined are not numbers"
Notice in the second example, because the y value was missing, the output said that undefined was not a number.

function getRelationship(x, y) {
    // Your code goes here!
    if(isNaN(x)){
        if(isNaN(y)){
            return "Can't compare relationships because " + x + " and " + y + " are not numbers";
        }
        return "Can't compare relationships because " + x + " is not a number";
    }else if(isNaN(y)){
        return "Can't compare relationships because " + y + " is not a number";
    }
    
    if(x<y){
        return "<";
    }else if(x>y){
        return ">";
    }else{
        return "=";
    }
}

// Try logging these functions to test your code!
console.log(getRelationship(1,4));
console.log(getRelationship(1,1));
console.log(getRelationship("that",2));
console.log(getRelationship("this"," something else"));
console.log(getRelationship(3));
console.log(getRelationship("hi"));
console.log(getRelationship(NaN));
console.log(getRelationship(NaN, undefined));
